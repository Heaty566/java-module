### Error with MainController

- None action parameter: this error happens when you apply main controller to a page that does not have any action parameter. Because javascript submit function doesn't send your action paramter in the `<form>` tag to the server. To fix this error, you can add a hidden input tag to your form like this:

  - Form this picture
